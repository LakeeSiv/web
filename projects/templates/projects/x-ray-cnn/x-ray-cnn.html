<p> Here you can see two chest X-rays, left being normal and right showing signs of pneumonia. You can clearly see that the right has areas of "haze", alluding to presence of pneumonia.</p>

<strong>	How could we get software to identify which one has pneumonia then? 
</strong>

<p>
Well, thats exactly where
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) comes into play. <br/>  CNNs are commonly used to classify images and this repository contains CNN that I created to solve that problem with an accuracy of <strong>89.7%</strong>!</p>


Using Tkinter I created a GUI which allows the user to see the model's prediction on the unseen test data.

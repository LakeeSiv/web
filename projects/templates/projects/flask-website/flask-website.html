<h2>Development</h2>
<hr />
<h4>Styling</h4>
<p>
	The majority of styling was done by using Bootstrap 5 and CSS. In certain
	areas I used external libraries like <code>typed.js</code> for typing
	animations and <code>highlight.js</code> for code blocks. Icons used in this
	website were taken from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">font awesome</a>.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Modular Components</h4>

<p>
	I wanted the site to be modular, so I can easily add new stuff like
	<a href="/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> and
	<a href="/about" target="_blank">timeline</a> objects. To do this I used
	JSON files to save information about certain components for example, I saved
	the data for each projects in the <code>projects.json</code> file. Here you
	can see the object for this website.
</p>

<pre>
	<code class="json">{
  "title": "Flask Website",
  "text": "This website you are on now was built with flask",
  "link": "flask-website",
  "img": "cardimgs/flask-website.PNG",
  "date": "5/4/21 - present",
  "github": "https://github.com/LakeeSiv/web",
  "tech": [
    "Flask",
    "Bootstrap",
    "Flask-Mail",
    "SendGrid's mail API",
    "Typed.js",
    "reCaptcha"
  ],
  "website": "https://lakee.herokuapp.com/"
}
	</code>
</pre>

<p>
	If I needed to change an attribute for a project, it is simple as just
	changing the JSON instead of having to change a block of HTML.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Contact Page</h4>
<p>
	The contact page was one of the first pages I tried to tackle. I firstly
	created the textarea elements then by using flask, I got the necessary
	information by taking reading the text in the elements when a POST request
	is made (which occurs when the send button is pressed)
</p>
<pre>
	<code class="python">if request.method == "POST":
    name = request.form["name"]
    email = request.form["email"]
    subject = request.form["subject"]
    message = request.form["message"]</code>
</pre>

<p>
	Now time to send me the email with the information. To do this I used the
	<code>Flask-Mail</code> library to easily send the email just by using a few
	lines of code. But I unexpectedly ran into an issue where the email does not
	get sent, when I deploy it. This was due to a security issue where gmail
	will not allow its email to be logged in on external websites (i.e Heroku).
	To fix this I resorted to setting up a SendGrid account and using their mail
	API to send emails. Then I implemented reCaptcha to prevent spam.
